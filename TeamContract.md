## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Instagram and Discord for our communication.

* Each teammate will respond to messages in at most within 2 hours during daytime (11am - 8pm). Even if they can't complete a given task at a certain time, acknowledge the message and specify when you will try to finish it.

* Teamates should notify each other if they are sick, can't meet a deadline for a given reason, or if they will be absent/late to a lab. 

* Actively listening to each members ideas, even if you are initially in disagreement. Giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, and making sure everyone is up to date and understands their tasks/the codebase.


---

## Work Quality and Participation


* If you plan to come, arrive at lab/lecture ideally on time, but at most 20 minutes after the hour.

* All deliverables should be compleed on time, tested and meet the agreed quality standard.

* Members agree to review each other's work constructively before submission, giving thorough advice.

* Each Pull Request will be reviewed by one team member if it is a very simple change, and at least two for any larger change.

---

## Decision Making

* We will make decisions by consensus when possible.

* Otherwise, we will make decisions about the team project by majority vote, but will try to see if multiple solutions can be accomodated first. 

---
## Conflict resolution

* We will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion.

* If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as a mediator.

* Be patient in discussions.

---

## Accountability

* Meeting team deadlines, not just the project deadlines.

* Be honest if you think you canot meet a deadline, as opposed to dragging it to the last minute and having others rely on code that isn't given.

* Don't overestimate how much work you are able to do, take reasonable steps.

* Don't underestimate how much work you have to do (don't procrasinate).

* Do proper code reviews, as opposed to just taking a glance at the code and approving it. Don't be afraid to object or raise questions.
